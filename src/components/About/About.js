                My name is Mikel Reed Balazic and I am a Designer, Artist, and creative based in the Greater Toronto Area. Graduating from York University's and Sheridan College's Bachelor of Design program, my main interest is finding a creative solution to a problem with efficiency and technical standard. My work credentials include interning at the Art Gallery of Ontario, freelance design, and currently working at Bell media as a graphic designer for SportsCentre on TSN. Ultimately, my work is involved with the world of communication, and it delights me most of all to know that I can create design that best reflects what message is being conveyed.
